Learning to impl complex systems like VirtualMachine in C

This project involves building a virtual machine from scratch by completing the following tasks:  

1. **Defining a Custom Instruction Set Architecture**  
   - [ ] Design opcodes for arithmetic and logical operations.  
   - [ ] Add instructions for control flow (jumps, branches).  
   - [ ] Implement stack-related instructions (e.g., PUSH, POP).  
   - [ ] Enable basic input/output operations.  

2. **Developing Core VM Components**  
   - [ ] Create a CPU core with registers and a program counter.  
   - [ ] Implement the fetch-decode-execute cycle.  
   - [ ] Develop memory management for reading, writing, and allocation.  

3. **Creating a Program Execution Framework**  
   - [ ] Build functionality to load and execute binary programs.  
   - [ ] Add support for recursion and function calls.  
   - [ ] Integrate basic I/O functionality for interacting with the VM.  

4. **Adding Debugging and Testing Capabilities**  
   - [ ] Implement step-by-step execution for debugging.  
   - [ ] Add memory and register inspection tools.  
   - [ ] Provide logging for program behavior analysis.  

5. **Laying the Foundation for Future Features**  
   - [ ] Design a modular and extensible architecture.  
   - [ ] Threading, interrupts, or hardware emulation.
